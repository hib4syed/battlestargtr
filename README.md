Hi everyone! This is Hiba Tasneem and Praveen from team Battlestar-GTR COMPETING IN THE Clash Competition. We are building an autonomous robot that follows a black line and sorts blocks on the basis of colours. So this repository os basically our personal journal/diary about our journey building this robot. Wish us luck!
